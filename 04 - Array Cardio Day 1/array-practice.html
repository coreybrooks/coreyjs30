//how to check which employee is missing from a large company.  I asked if it could be considered an array of objects
//he mentioned hash-tables as a way to limit the 'O(N)' value? i gave two possible ways, the following was his suggestion:

//make and array of all employees with unique ids, then sum the ids of the present employees and compare to the id total, 
//the difference is the id of the missing employee

//make employee array and sum ids
const employees = [{name: 'john',id:1},{name: 'jane', id: 2},{name: 'jack', id: 3},{name: 'jill', id: 4}];
const idTotal = employees.reduce((total, employee) => {
        return total + employee.id;
}, 0);

console.log({idTotal});

//make an array of present employees
const presentEmployees = [{name: 'john',id:1},{name: 'jane', id: 2},{name: 'jack', id: 3}];
const presentTotal = presentEmployees.reduce((total, employee) => {
	return total + employee.id;
},0);

console.log({presentTotal});

//find the id of the missing employee and display their name
const missingEmployee = employees.find(employee => employee.id === (idTotal - presentTotal));
console.log(`missing employee: ${missingEmployee.name}`);

//=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

//practice making constructors
let NewPerson = function(name, age, hobby) {
	let person = {name, age, hobby};
	console.log(person);
	return person;
};

const one = NewPerson("jack", 21, "music");
const two = NewPerson("jill", 22, "math");
const three = NewPerson("john", 23, "beer");

let people = [];

people.push(one);
people.push(two);
people.push(three);

console.table(people);
