//how to check which employee is missing from a large company.  I asked if it could be considered an array of objects
//he mentioned hash-tables as a way to limit the 'O(N)' value? i gave two possible ways, the following was his suggestion:

//make and array of all employees with unique ids, then sum the ids of the present employees and compare to the id total, 
//the difference is the id of the missing employee

//make employee array and sum ids
const employees = [{name: 'john',id:1},{name: 'jane', id: 2},{name: 'jack', id: 3},{name: 'jill', id: 4}];
const idTotal = employees.reduce((total, employee) => {
        return total + employee.id;
}, 0);

console.log({idTotal});

//make an employee of present employees
const presentEmployees = [{name: 'john',id:1},{name: 'jane', id: 2},{name: 'jack', id: 3}];
const presentTotal = presentEmployees.reduce((total, employee) => {
	return total + employee.id;
},0);

console.log({presentTotal});

missingId = idTotal - presentTotal;

const missingEmployee = employees.filter(employee => employee.id === missingId ? 1: 0);
console.log(missingEmployee[0].name);
